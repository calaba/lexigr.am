If you have used the skill before, you can just copy your existing kodi.config file to the directory you've been working out of in the command line tool.

If you haven't done this before, let's go ahead and download an sample file.
``` bash
lexigram init-config
```

Open up this file in your favorite text editor. The minimum values needed are these: `address, port, username, password` (Address is the one you copied earlier). If you have these correct, you are ready to go.
