If you have successfully done the other steps before this, all you should have to do at this point is:
``` bash
lexigram deploy kanzi
```
OR
``` bash
lexigram deploy koko
```

It will ask you what endpoint your server code is running at. Just paste that in, and everything will be deployed to Amazon. Give yourself a pat on the back because you are done.
